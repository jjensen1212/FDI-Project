        <h2>Purpose of this website</h2>

        <p>The purpose of this website is to inform the academic community, particularly students, about the virtues and attributes of one of the key elements of the global economy: <b><i>foreign direct investment (FDI)</i></b>.
        </p>

        <p> In a world that has witnessed a trend towards retrenchment and nationalism in recent years, it is important to emphasize the benefits of economic openness and international cooperation. Those benefits include economic growth, the flow of people and ideas, an unprecedented reduction of poverty, among others. Fostering economic activity through foreign direct investment is a fundamental component of such economic openness and international co-operation.
