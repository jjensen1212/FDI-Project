        <h1>What is FDI? Why is it important for development?</h1>
        <p>FDI can be broadly defined as international flows of money aimed at acquiring a lasting interest in an asset (e.g. an enterprise, a building, an infrastructure). The sources of money can be very diverse, including public enterprises, sovereign funds, businesspeople, pension funds, hedge funds, etc. A defining feature of FDI is in the word 'lasting', which distinguishes it from 'portfolio investments' of a much shorter and speculative nature (for example, investing in assets such as stocks or bonds with the expectation that their prices will increase in the short term). Below is a list of FDI definitions from different sources.</p>
        <p>FDI is an important engine for development, particularly in places that lack enough resources to start and sustain productive activities. In those places, FDI can lead to the creation of new firms, the expansion of existing ones, and the creation of jobs. It can also lead to positive spillover effects by dynamizing local and domestic economies, for example by creating demand for inputs, new skills, better infrastructure, etc. Furthermore, FDI is also linked to the transfer of new technologies and production methods. FDI is also beneficial for countries that have reached a given level of 'economic maturity' and which need to find new markets for their products and services, as well as for those that aim to tap into cheaper or better sources of inputs such as labor, materials, natural resources, etc.<p>


        <H2>FDI definitions</H2>
        
        <li>FDI is a category of cross-border investment in which an investor resident in one economy establishes a lasting interest in and a significant degree of influence over an enterprise resident in another economy. Ownership of 10 percent or more of the voting power in an enterprise in one economy by an investor in another economy is evidence of such a relationship. FDI is a key element in international economic integration because it creates stable and long-lasting links between economies. FDI is an important channel for the transfer of technology between countries, promotes international trade through access to foreign markets, and can be an important vehicle for economic development. The indicators covered in this group are inward and outward values for stocks, flows and income, by partner country and by industry and FDI restrictiveness.(<a href='https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/finance-and-investment/foreign-direct-investment-fdi/indicator-group/english_9a523b18-en'>OECD)</a></li>
        <li>FDI are the net inflows of investment to acquire a lasting management interest (10 percent or more of voting stock) in an enterprise operating in an economy other than that of the investor. It is the sum of equity capital, reinvestment of earnings, other long-term capital, and short-term capital as shown in the balance of payments.

        <li>FDI is defined as an investment reflecting a lasting interest and control by a foreign direct investor, resident in one economy, in an enterprise resident in another economy (foreign affiliate).(<a href='https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/tdstat44_FS09_en.pdf'>UNCTAD)</a></li>
